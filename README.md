# Microsoft Movie Analysis 


#### Author: Ahmet Karaoglan 

### Overview 

This project represents a preliminary study of the entry into the microsoft film industry. The company, which is very new in this sector, made front studies by making use of the large database containing the data of movies such as IMDB, TMDB, ROTTEN TOMATOES. We decided to examine the director, genre and movie revenues. We determined which film genres had a more successful effect on the directors' revenues. Using this data, Microsoft can decide which movies it would be right to start with in its new project.

### Business Problem

Microsoft is the world leader in its field, but the film industry is also very new in terms of know-how, the company should decide how much budget it has outside of this project and decide on the film it will shoot. The results of the data and analyzes I have collected show the following. Genre and revenue data of the directors have determined the genre that provides the least risk for companies that have just started in the film industry, it seems that drama is the genre that gives the highest rating in the world and the film industry also wins the most awards. It would be more accurate to start the Microsoft drama movie field as well.
